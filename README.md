Introduction
sMap is a software package that, among other things, is based on OpenLayers. The purpose of the package is to provide a complete framework and associated extensions that make it possible to build advanced map applications on the web.

For more information about the sMap project, contact our project coordinators. See at the bottom.

Extent
sMap as a product consists of source code developed by the sMap project. This program code is released under the Apache Software License 2.0.

The product itself is based on a number of third-party libraries such as OpenLayers, jqgrid, Spin.js and more. These are not part of the sMap product but are provided as is. The copyright for these belongs to their respective authors, and they are licensed under their own license.

The packaging of sMap (ie, the contents of this source code repository), consists partly of the sMap product, partly of the necessary third-party libraries.

Important information regarding data sources
Data sources, whether belonging to the sMap project, sMap project participants or anyone else are not included in either product or packaging.

You must seek permission to use them from the respective publisher and/or copyright holder. This also applies if we were to link to them in any program code.
